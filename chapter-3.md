# Marrakech

When one visits a new place, they tend to compare it with the places they have visited before. Marrakech is beyond compare. My closest comparison would be the narrow streets in the Old City of Jerusalem. Unlike the Old City, which is heavily guarded the Marrakech market is a bedlam of chaos. 

In keeping with tradition, vendors have to be haggled with for the "best price." The vendors can smell tourists, so even a fair price would be out of the question. As an emerging economy, the market sections were subdivided by trades:

- Fruit vendors
- Antique vendors
- Leather workers
- Fabric dyers 
- Blacksmiths
- Jewelers
- Butchers

...and many more...
