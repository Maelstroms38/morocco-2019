# Moroccan Mysteries

Morocco is a land of mysteries. Visiting for the first time, one begins to wonder if the land belongs in Africa or the Middle East. The land itself shifts with a diverse palette of colors. Beige dunes, blue oceans and green oasis share desert roads between major cities: 

###  - [Rabat](https://michaelstromer.nyc/books/moroccan-mysteries/rabat)
###  - [Casablanca](https://michaelstromer.nyc/books/moroccan-mysteries/casablanca)
###  - [Marrakech](https://michaelstromer.nyc/books/moroccan-mysteries/marrakech)

Major cities are few and far between. These ancient cities hold a solemn oath, to protect their rich histories. One can see these cities are rooted with seaside fortresses, mosques and gardens. Upon a chance visit, one may have the impression of going back in time. 
 
Morocco marries it's French heritage with Middle Eastern culture. Listen to any snippet of conversation and you may hear tongues of French and Arabic descent. Walk through the market of Marrakech and you may get called out to by a snake charmer or antique vendor. 

Like a picture book, this showcase features images for each major city.
